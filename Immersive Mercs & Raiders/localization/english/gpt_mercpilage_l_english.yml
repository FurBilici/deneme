 gptmerc_chevauchee_gold_desc: "My Master of Raids, [gptmerc_mraid.GetTitledFirstName], approaches me with a bold proposition. [gptmerc_mraid.GetSheHe|U] suggests launching a Chevauchée – a swift, mounted raid – deep into the lands of [gptmerc_target.GetTitledFirstName]. The primary goal: plunder. [gptmerc_mraid.GetSheHe|U] believes we can extract significant wealth by targeting vulnerable settlements and supply lines.\n\n[gptmerc_mraid.GetSheHe|U] has already identified three capable knights for the task: [gptmerc_knight_1.GetTitledFirstName], [gptmerc_knight_2.GetTitledFirstName], and [gptmerc_knight_3.GetTitledFirstName]."
 gptmerc_chevauchee_prestige_desc: "My Master of Raids, [gptmerc_mraid.GetTitledFirstName], presents an opportunity for glory. [gptmerc_mraid.GetSheHe|U] proposes a Chevauchée, a lightning raid targeting the heartlands of [gptmerc_target.GetTitledFirstName]. While spoils are expected, the main objective is to strike a blow that will enhance our renown and demonstrate our martial prowess far and wide.\n\nThree knights stand ready to lead the charge: [gptmerc_knight_1.GetTitledFirstName], [gptmerc_knight_2.GetTitledFirstName], and [gptmerc_knight_3.GetTitledFirstName]."
 gptmerc_chevauchee_dread_desc: "My Master of Raids, [gptmerc_mraid.GetTitledFirstName], speaks in hushed, grim tones of a potential Chevauchée against [gptmerc_target.GetTitledFirstName]. This mounted raid would not primarily seek riches or fame, but terror. By burning and pillaging with calculated cruelty, we can sow dread amongst our neighbours and remind them of the consequences of defiance.\n\nThe knights selected for this grim task are [gptmerc_knight_1.GetTitledFirstName], [gptmerc_knight_2.GetTitledFirstName], and [gptmerc_knight_3.GetTitledFirstName]."

I want to fight!\"\n\nMy Master of Raids, [gptmerc_mraid.GetFirstName], watches with a stern expression, perhaps evaluating the child's mettle, or perhaps thinking of the risks. It is a dangerous venture, but the experience could forge [gptmerc_heir.GetHerHis] character... or break it."
 gptmerc_chevauchee_bold_child_option_1: "[gptmerc_heir.GetFirstName] shall ride. Let [gptmerc_heir.GetHerHim] prove [gptmerc_heir.GetHerHis] worth!"

 gptmerc_chevauchee_select_knight_title: "Choosing the Vanguard"
 gptmerc_chevauchee_select_knight_desc: "The raiding party requires a leader, someone to command the knights and make tactical decisions during the Chevauchée. My Master of Raids has presented the three candidates, each a proven warrior in their own right.\n\n[gptmerc_knight_1.GetFirstName] grips [gptmerc_knight_1.GetHerHis] weapon with quiet confidence, [gptmerc_knight_2.GetFirstName] stands resolute behind [gptmerc_knight_2.GetHerHis] shield, and [gptmerc_knight_3.GetFirstName] hefts [gptmerc_knight_3.GetHerHis] axe with a fierce glint in [gptmerc_knight_3.GetHerHis] eye.\n\nWhom shall I entrust with leading this dangerous venture?"

They await my final command!\n\nHorses snort impatiently, leather creaks, and the air thrums with anticipation.
